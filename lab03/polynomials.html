<h1>Polynomials</h1>

    <p>If your problem can be modeled with a low-order polynomial equation, then it won't stay a problem for long. Let's look at the forms of the four simplest orders:</p>
    
    <dl>
    <dt>Constant</dt>
    <dd>Constant polynomials have the form a</dd>
    
    <dl>Linear</dl>
    <dd>Linear polynomials have the form a &times; x &plus; b.</dd>
    
    <dl>Quadratic</dl>
    <dd>Quadratic polynomials have the form a &times; x<sup>2</sup> &plus; b &times; x &plus; c.</dd>
  
    <dl>Cubic</dl>
    <dd>Cubic polynomials have the form a &times; x<sup>3</sup> &plus; b &times; x<sup>2</sup> &plus; c &times; x &plus; d.</dd>
    </dl>
